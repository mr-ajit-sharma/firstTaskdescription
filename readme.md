1. API Endpoints:
- Create an endpoint to add a new task.
- Create an endpoint to retrieve all tasks.
- Create an endpoint to retrieve a single task by its ID.
- Create an endpoint to update a task by its ID.
- Create an endpoint to delete a task by its ID.
2. Database:
- Use a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g.,
MongoDB) to store task information.
- Design the database schema to include at least the following fields for each task: ID, title,
description, creation date, status.
- Ensure proper indexing for performance optimization.
3. Business Logic:
- Include validation to check for invalid inputs (e.g., empty strings, invalid dates).
- Implement error handling to manage different types of errors and return appropriate
status codes and messages.
